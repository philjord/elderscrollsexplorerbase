Thigns to do:

make shaders work,
make only shader morrowind, sky, land, water, particles

make a small morrowind bsa file, using modern half floats system, and look at dds format, I see twice size skyrim image s at same file siaze
morrowind, drop unneeded file, compress all, put splash screens in bsa etc

make java3d not need awt, at all

look at ftransform missing issue, need to pass gl_mvp matrix through

think about jbullet stack alloc gear, maybe remove?

possibly make a bsa for the newer morrowind stuff, note they have shader in there too

look at all the other shader, FOMM of oblivion, mojoshader etc
