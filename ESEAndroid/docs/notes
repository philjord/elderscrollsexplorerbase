
I should fork the java3d projects into my own area, then somehow fork them again across to java3d-and?


Approach bethesda get rights to ip?

kickstarter campaign, explorer, game, google cardboard game

ASM for jbullet has ASMdex on android port across

Things to do:

Must build Jake2, worldwind and ardor3d example on android and make them work!

Shadows in the pipeline 

MUST attach torch to player, point light source, with on off and color setting in settings

make shaders work,
make shader for sky, land, water, particles (done?)

make a small morrowind bsa file, using modern half floats system, and look at dds format, I see twice size skyrim image s at same file siaze
morrowind, drop unneeded file, compress all, put splash screens in bsa etc

make java3d not need awt, at all

look at ftransform missing issue, need to pass gl_mvp matrix through

think about jbullet stack alloc gear, maybe remove? asmdex apparently is the asm equivilent

possibly make a bsa for the newer morrowind stuff, note they have shader in there too (HLSL but)

look at all the other shader, FOMM of oblivion, mojoshader etc


GLSL code translation notes,

Note I really need to ensure all attributes are bound and loaded against and all uniforms are bound too

I've used attribute for t and b seems fine
I can't hand bool types across so I have to change to int type and then use ==1 or bool() 

This size issue might not be very important, depending if the gl_Vertex usage is normalized afterwards
my gl_Vertex is 1/0.02 smaller than his, so maths on it might look funny 
To rescale I MUST multiply by vec4(50.0,50.0,50.0,1) (w=1 for point w=0 for normal)
if I go gl_Vertex *=50 w is screwed? or just x is multiplied or something bad

TODO 
Skyrim trees missng the tree shader code
LAND
Background and skies
F:\game media\Oblivion\meshes\dungeons\fortruins\exterior\ruinstonesexterior\runestoneext01glyph01.nif
mine has a fat glyph

my xyz is swizzle normal maps and spec maps must be swizzled in shaders! No just breaks stuff odd

most oblivion armour uses the FFP

Skyrim tree shader for vertex colors -SLSF2_Tree_Anim done in jonwd7 code

particles are not using shaders

outlining needs an outliner shader too or does it stay ffp

set up time controllers for textures, I notice nifskope suggests only 2 possible controllers

ShaderAttributeSetRetained is broken it only updates once so changing uniforms are not passed through anymore, hence water knows not the the time




Note i can throw byte arrays at shaders and get float and half float in shader no bitstofloat needed
I could swizzle axis in shader if i wanted too .
