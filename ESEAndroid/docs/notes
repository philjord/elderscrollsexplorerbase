Things to do:

MUST attach torch to player, point light source, with on off and color setting in settings

make shaders work,
make shader for sky, land, water, particles (done?)

make a small morrowind bsa file, using modern half floats system, and look at dds format, I see twice size skyrim image s at same file siaze
morrowind, drop unneeded file, compress all, put splash screens in bsa etc

make java3d not need awt, at all

look at ftransform missing issue, need to pass gl_mvp matrix through

think about jbullet stack alloc gear, maybe remove?

possibly make a bsa for the newer morrowind stuff, note they have shader in there too (HLSL but)

look at all the other shader, FOMM of oblivion, mojoshader etc


GLSL code translation notes,
SLSF2_Tree_Anim
Note I really need to ensure all attributes are bound and loaded against and all uniforms are bound too

I've used attribute for t and b seems fine
I can't hand bool types across so I have to change to int type and then use ==1 or bool() 

This size issue might not be very important, depending if the gl_Vertex usage is normalized afterwards
my gl_Vertex is 1/0.02 smaller than his, so maths on it might look funny 
To rescale I MUST multiply by vec4(50.0,50.0,50.0,1) (w=1 for point w=0 for normal)
if I go gl_Vertex *=50 w is screwed? or just x is multiplied or something bad

TODO 
Skyrim trees missng the tree shader code
LAND
Background and skies
F:\game media\Oblivion\meshes\dungeons\fortruins\exterior\ruinstonesexterior\runestoneext01glyph01.nif
mine has a fat glyph

most oblivion armour uses the FFP

Skyrim tree sahder for vertex colors

particles are not using shaders

outlining needs an outliner shader too
